Aside from the Sun and Moon, Venus is the brightest natural object in Earth's sky.<br><br>The CO2-rich atmosphere generates the strongest greenhouse effect in the Solar System, creating surface temperatures of at least 864 °F (462 °C). This makes the Venusian surface hotter than Mercury's.</p>

            <p>A comet is an icy, small Solar System body that warms and begins to release gases when passing close to the Sun, a process called outgassing. This produces an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere or coma surrounding the nucleus, and sometimes a tail of gas and dust gas blown out from the coma.<br><br> The comet nucleus is thought to be no more than about 16 kilometers across. They are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles.</p>
